# GY88
Basic code for BMP085/BMP180, MPU6050, and HMC5883L, bundled together for the GY88 10DOF IMU
This code is being written so that it can be referenced by other python programs.
If anyone wants a C++, arduino, any other language, I only know how to implement this in python, so please fork and make a pull request. I will probably accept it
